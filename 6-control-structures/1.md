# For Loop

- Go has only one looping construct, the for loop.
- The basic for loop has three components separated by semicolons:
  - the init statement: executed before the first iteration
  - the condition expression: evaluated before every iteration
  - the post statement: executed at the end of every iteration
- The init statement will often be a short variable declaration, and the variables declared there are visible only in the scope of the for statement.
- The loop will stop iterating once the boolean condition evaluates to false.
