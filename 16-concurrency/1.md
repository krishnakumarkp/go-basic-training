# Concurrency

Concurrency is an ability of a program to do multiple things at the same time. This means a program that have two or more tasks that run individually of each other, at about the same time, but remain part of the same program.

- Concurrency in Golang is the ability for functions to run independent of each other.
- Functions that are run concurrently are called Goroutines in golang
- To run a function as a goroutine, call that function prefixed with the go statement.


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// Function that prints a message repeatedly
func printAlphabets() {
	for i := 'a'; i <= 'e'; i++ {
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		fmt.Printf("Alphabet: %c\n", i)
	}
}

// Function that prints numbers repeatedly
func printNumbers() {
	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		fmt.Printf("Number: %d\n", i)
	}
}

func main() {
	// Launch two goroutines
	//go printMessage("Hello")
	//go printNumbers()

	printMessage("Hello")
	printNumbers()

	// Sleep for some time to allow goroutines to execute
	time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)

	fmt.Println("Main function exiting.")
}


```
