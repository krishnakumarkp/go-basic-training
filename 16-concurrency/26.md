# Race Condition

A race condition occurs when two or more routines try to access the resource like variable or data structure and attempt to read or write the resources without regard to other routines. So it will create tremendous problems.

For detecting whether there is a race condition in your program or not

go run -race main.go

# Mutex
Mutex stands for Mutual Exclusion. Mutex is used for achieving synchronization in Golang and for accessing data safely for multiple goroutines.
(only one goroutine can access a variable at a time to avoid conflicts)

# Atomicity

Atomicity is like mutex for managing state of a user. From Go 1.4 , there is another library offered by Go for achieving thread safety in sync/atomic and has been providing low-level primitives.

## Donâ€™t communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating is the main proverb of Golang.
