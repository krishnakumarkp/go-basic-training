# Buffered Channel


## Unbuffered
Unbuffered channels have no capacity and therefore require both goroutines to be ready to make any exchange. When a goroutine attempts to send a resource to an unbuffered channel and there is no goroutine waiting to receive the resource, the channel will lock the sending goroutine and make it wait. When a goroutine attempts to receive from an unbuffered channel, and there is no goroutine waiting to send a resource, the channel will lock the receiving goroutine and make it wait.

Buffered channels have capacity and therefore can behave a bit differently. When a goroutine attempts to send a resource to a buffered channel and the channel is full, the channel will lock the goroutine and make it wait until a buffer becomes available. If there is room in the channel, the send can take place immediately and the goroutine can move on. When a goroutine attempts to receive from a buffered channel and the buffered channel is empty, the channel will lock the goroutine and make it wait until a resource has been sent.
