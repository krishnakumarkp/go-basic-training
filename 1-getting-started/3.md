- long compilation time of C++
- Execution speed of python
- Code mess you get in c++ if you donâ€™t have strict guidelines.
- Slow programming process
  - string processing and concurrency very tedious without garbage collection.
  - Clumsy type systems made programming hard.
  - Inheritance tree(type hierarchy) was hard to handle.
  - Lack good concurrent programming primitives
  - Long time needed in training New developers and making them productive 


C++ allows for complex types, including pointers, references, classes, structs, templates, and multiple inheritance. While this flexibility can be powerful, it also introduces complexity, especially for novice programmers making it harder for programmers to write correct, maintainable, and bug-free code 

C++ supports both single and multiple inheritance, as well as polymorphism through virtual functions. While these features are powerful, they can lead to complex inheritance hierarchies.

Diamond problem

       A
      / \
     B   C
      \ /
       D

in this hierarchy, classes B and C both inherit from class A, and class D inherits from both B and C. This creates a diamond shape in the inheritance hierarchy.

Now, suppose class A has a method foo(), and both classes B and C override this method. When class D inherits from both B and C, it effectively inherits two versions of the foo() method, one from B and one from C.

The diamond problem occurs when there's ambiguity about which version of the overridden method to use in the derived class (D in this case). This ambiguity arises because both B and C inherit from A and override the same method, and D inherits from both B and C.
