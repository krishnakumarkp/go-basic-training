# Go Package

A package is nothing but a directory inside your Go workspace containing one or more Go source files.
Package helps to organize related code together and avoids naming conflicts

## Steps

1. Create folder go-training/package
2. go mod init go-training/package
3. Create main.go
4. mkdir /go-training/package/company
5. cd company
6. make company.go

To declare a source file to be part of a package, we use the following syntax as the first line of every file in the package
package <packagename>.(packagename will be the foldername)

```
package company

import (
	"fmt"
)
var companyName string = "google"

func PrintCompany() {
	fmt.Println(companyName)
}
```

7. in /go-training/package/main.go

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"go-training/package/company"
)

func main() {
	company.PrintCompany()
}
```
8. in /go-training/package/company/department.go

```
package company

import "fmt"

func PrintDepartment() {
	fmt.Printf("Engineering department at %s \n", companyName)
}
```

9. in /go-training/package/main.go
   
```
func main() {
	company.PrintCompany()
	company.PrintDepartment()
}
```

- PrintDepartment() function in department.go could access the global variable comapnyName in company.go
- PrintCompnay() and PrintDepartment() function even though are in different files belongs to same package company. 
- global variables declared in any files in a package are available  through out that package.
- If a global variable oR function inside a package starts with an uppercase letter , it gets exported outside the package (private, public)


10. Nested packages  create folder /go-training/package/company/location

11. create file location.go

```
package location

import (
	"fmt"
)

var locationName string = "pune"

func PrintLocation() {
	fmt.Println(locationName)
}

```

12. in main.go

```

package main

import (
	"go-training/package/company"
	"go-training/package/company/location"
)

func main() {
	company.PrintCompany()
	company.PrintDepartment()
	location.PrintLocation()
}

```

13. in company.go if you need to use location

```
package company

import (
	"fmt"
	"go-training/package/company/location"
)

var companyName string = "google"

func PrintCompany() {
	fmt.Println(companyName)
	location.PrintLocation()
}

```

14. create new package client  create folder client

15. Create new file client.go

```
package client

import (
	"fmt"
)

var clientName string = "Remitly"

func PrintClient() {
	fmt.Println(clientName)
}

```

16. in main.go

```
func main() {
	company.PrintCompany()
	company.PrintDepartment()
	location.PrintLocation()
	client.PrintClient()
}
```

17. in client.go

```
func PrintClient() {
	fmt.Println(clientName, "is client of")
	company.PrintCompany()

}

```

18. in department.go

```
func PrintDepartment() {
	fmt.Printf("Engineering department at %s \n", companyName)
	fmt.Printf("working for client")
	client.PrintClient()
}
```

will give you the error  import cycle not allowed
