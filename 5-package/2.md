# init() function

- The init function is a function that takes no argument and returns nothing. This function executes after the package is imported
- The init function in Go should be used to do the tasks we want to do before doing all other things in that file. That means it is more suited to tasks like initializations
- A package can have multiple init functions (either in a single file or distributed across multiple files) and they are called in the order in which they are presented to the compiler.

## steps

1. main.go
```
func init() {
	fmt.Println("Main initialization called")
}
```
2. Company.go
```
func init() {
	fmt.Println("Company initialization called")
}
```
3. Department.go
```
func init() {
	fmt.Println("Department initialization called")
}

```

1. If a package imports other packages, the imported packages are initialized first.
2. Current package's constant initialized then.
3. Current package's variables are initialized then.
4. Finally, init() function of current package is called.
