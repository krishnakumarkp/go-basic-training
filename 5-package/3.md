# Constants

- Constants are declared like variables, but with the const keyword.
- Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values.
- Constants cannot be declared using the := syntax

Steps

1. in constant.go
```
company.PrintCompany()
company.PrintDepartment()
//typed and untyped constant
const a int64 = 8
//local constant with same name as global constant
const b = 8

var c int64
c = a
c = b
fmt.Println(c)

//problem with typed constant
//var growth float64
var growth float32
//var growth float16
growth = company.GrowthPercentage
fmt.Println("growth percentage = ", growth)
```

2. in company.go
```
const GrowthPercentage float64 = 6.1415926535897932384

```
- Try changing  type of growth from float64 to float32
- Try changing constant GrowthPercentage to untyped constant
- Try changing type of growth from float32 to float16
