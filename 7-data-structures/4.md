# Slices

- An array has a fixed size. A slice, on the other hand, is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array. In practice, slices are much more common than arrays.
- Slices are like references to arrays. A slice does not store any data, it just describes a section of an underlying array.
- Changing the elements of a slice modifies the corresponding elements of its underlying array.
- Other slices that share the same underlying array will see those changes.
