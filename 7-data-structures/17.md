# Maps

- A map is an unordered collection of key/value pairs, where each key is unique. (sometimes called hashes or dictionaries in other languages).
- To declare a map type variable var m map[key-type] val-type
- The zero value of a map is nil.
- A map need to be initialized to be ready for use.
- To initialize an empty map, use the built-in function make. m = make(map[key-type]val-type).
- Map is of reference type
