# Arrays, Slices and Maps

- Arrays  
  - collection of variables of the same type
  - An array's length is part of its type, so arrays cannot be resized. 
  - consist of contiguous memory locations 
  - Array variable is of value type not of reference type.
- Slices
  - A slice is a dynamically-sized
  - Slices are like references to arrays
- Maps
  - A map maps keys to values.
