# Slices 

- slices hold references to an underlying array
- if you assign one slice to another, both refer to the same array
- changing the elements of a slice modifies the corresponding elements of its underlying array
- If we modify elements of slice, it modifies corresponding array, and all other slices that refers to it.
- the length of a slice may be changed as long as it still fits within the limits of the underlying array.
- the capacity of a slice, accessible by the built-in function cap, reports the maximum length the slice may assume. 
- If the data exceeds the capacity, the slice is reallocated. Built-in append will do it for us;
- append + copy give us the functionality needed for array programming operations like: inserting, popping, pushing, reversing deleting and so on.

# Should you use Arrays or Slices?

- If the entity is described by a set of non-empty items of a fixed length: use arrays.
- When describing a general collection that you would add or remove elements from, use slices.
- If a collection can contain any number of elements, use slices.
- Will you be modifying the collection in some way? If yes, then use slices
