# Empty interface

When an interface has zero methods, it is called an empty interface. This is represented by interface{}. Since the empty interface has zero methods, all types implement this interface implicitly.

How does the Println function from the fmt built-in package accepts the different types of value as arguments? This is possible because of an empty interface.

    func Println(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
