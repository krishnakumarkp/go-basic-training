# Interfaces

* An ‘interface’ is a contract which describes behaviour of a type. An interface is a collection of method signatures that a Type can implement (using methods). Hence interface defines (not declares) the behavior of the object (of the type Type).
* When a type provides definition for all the methods in the interface, it is said to impliment 
the interface

# Interfaces are implemented implicitly

A type implements an interface by implementing its methods. There is no explicit declaration of intent, no "implements" keyword.
