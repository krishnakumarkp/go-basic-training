# Interfaces

* An ‘interface’ is a contract which describes behaviour of a type

```java
interface Person {
  public void talk(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void walk(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void eat(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}
```

### in go there two kinds of types abstract type and concrete types

* concrete types (all the the basic data types, and all the composit types and all the defined types)
behavior is attached to types using methods

```go
type Number int

func(n Number) Positive() bool {

}

```

* Abstract type (interfaces)

they describe behavior
they define a set of methods, without specifying the receiver

```go
type Positiver interface {
	Positive() bool
}
```

# Interfaces are implemented implicitly
 When a type provides definition for all the methods in the interface, it is said to impliment the interface
A type implements an interface by implementing its methods. There is no explicit declaration of intent, no "implements" keyword.


```go
type Positiver interface {
	Positive() bool
}

type Number int

func(n Number) Positive() bool {
    return n > 0
}

```










* in object oriented programming a interface is a common means for unrealted objects to communicate with each other.

```java
// Define the ElectronicDevice interface
interface ElectronicDevice {
    void turnOn();
    void turnOff();
}

// Implement the interface in unrelated classes
class Smartphone implements ElectronicDevice {
    @Override
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("Smartphone is turning on.");
    }

    @Override
    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("Smartphone is turning off.");
    }
}

class Laptop implements ElectronicDevice {
    @Override
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("Laptop is turning on.");
    }

    @Override
    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("Laptop is turning off.");
    }
}

// Define the Person class
class Person {
    public void operateElectronicDevice(ElectronicDevice device) {
        System.out.println("Operating the electronic device:");
        device.turnOn();
        device.turnOff();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ElectronicDevice myPhone = new Smartphone();
        ElectronicDevice myLaptop = new Laptop();
        Person person = new Person();

        // Operate the smartphone
        person.operateElectronicDevice(myPhone);

        // Operate the laptop
        person.operateElectronicDevice(myLaptop);
    }
}
```



* An ‘interface’ is a contract which describes behaviour of a type. An interface is a collection of method signatures that a Type can implement (using methods). Hence interface defines (not declares) the behavior of the object (of the type Type).
* When a type provides definition for all the methods in the interface, it is said to impliment 
the interface

# Interfaces are implemented implicitly

A type implements an interface by implementing its methods. There is no explicit declaration of intent, no "implements" keyword.
