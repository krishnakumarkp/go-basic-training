# Interfaces

* An ‘interface’ is  defined as a set of method signatures which describes behaviour of a type

```java
interface Person {
  public void talk(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void walk(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void eat(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}
```

### in go there two kinds of types abstract type and concrete types

* concrete types (all the the basic data types, and all the composit types and all the defined types)
behavior is attached to types using methods

```go
type Number int

func(n Number) Positive() bool {

}

```

* Abstract type (interfaces)

they describe behavior
they define a set of methods, without specifying the receiver

```go
type Positiver interface {
	Positive() bool
}
```

# Interfaces are implemented implicitly
 When a type provides definition for all the methods in the interface, it is said to impliment the interface
A type implements an interface by implementing its methods. There is no explicit declaration of intent, no "implements" keyword.


```go
type Positiver interface {
	Positive() bool
}

type Number int

func(n Number) Positive() bool {
    return n > 0
}

```
