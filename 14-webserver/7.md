There is also another servemux http.DefaultServeMux which is a global ServeMux instance.
if you  pass nil as the value of handler to the ListenAndServe function Go will internally use the http.DefaultServeMux

We can add routes and handler functions to this instance by using the functions exposed by the http package.

The http.HandleFunc function provided  does the exact same thing that the mux.HandleFunc does.
It adds a handler function to the http.DefaultServeMux to handle HTTP requests of a specific route path.
