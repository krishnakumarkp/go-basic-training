# Webserver

The problem with ServeHTTP method of MyHttpHandler is that it responds to all the requests. But in a real world web app there will be differnet routes

get http://localhost:8080/books

get http://localhost:8080/books/213

post http://localhost:8080/books

to achive this we need a some thing called a multiplexer.

tell about default multiplexer 8.go



solution is ServeMux

The ServeMux is a built-in struct type exported from the http package, that acts as HTTP request multiplexer.
ServeMux implements the ServeHTTP method which will make it implement the Handler interface
