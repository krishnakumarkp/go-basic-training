# inbuilt http package

## Handler
The handler is an interface with only one method and that method has two parameters: response writer and a pointer of request.

    type Handler interface {
        ServeHTTP(ResponseWriter, *Request) 
    }  

## Http.ServeMux
  
    mux := http.NewServeMux()
    mux.Handle("/", handler)
    mux.HandleFunc("/hello/golang", func(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprint(res, "Hello Golang!")
    })
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", h)

## http.DefaultServeMux
  
    // handle `/` route to `http.DefaultServeMux`
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello World!")
    })
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)

## http.HandlerFunc
The HandlerFunc type is an adapter to allow the use of ordinary functions as HTTP handlers

    h := HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello Golang!")
    })

    http.ListenAndServe(":80", h)
  


#  downside of in-built route

The default routing system(ServeMux) doesnâ€™t support request methods (Like GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) while routing, it means inside the callback you need to mention the type of method you expect.

Declare complex routes
With ServeMux, we cannot declare complex routes with variables, constrain routes with methods, etc.

Get captured variables
We declared routes with variables (for example id in /users/:id) , we have to manually capture the values of those variables in handlers.

    http.HandleFunc("/users/", func(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
        id := strings.SplitN(req.URL.Path, "/", 3)[2]
    })

There is an external package far better than default routing https://github.com/gorilla/mux
, It supports many things along with routing.
