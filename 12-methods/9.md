# Composition Instead of Inheritance 

Go does not support inheritance, however, it does support composition. The generic definition of composition is "put together". One example of composition is a car. A car is composed of wheels, an engine and various other parts.

## Methods Composition by embedding structs 

Composition can be achieved in Go is by embedding one struct type into another.
