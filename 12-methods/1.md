# Methods

## what is a method ?
* A method is a function, that is attached to a specific type.
* it defines the behavior of the type
  
A method is defined with slightly different syntax than a normal function.
It required an additional parameter known as a receiver which is a type
to which the function belongs. This way, a method (function) can access
the properties of the receiver it belongs to
